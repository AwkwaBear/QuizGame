//This is an example for the format of the questions in the text file
//Each text file will be of a different topic
//When the game is initialized a vector for each topic will be created
//Question objects will be generated for each question saving the correct answer and randomizing //the answer order
//Question object example
class Question{
  string question; //string to store the question
  string answer_A; //string to store each answer
  string answer_B;
  string answer_C;
  char correct;


}

//The question objects will be placed in their corresponding in the text file and placed in the vector
//the order of the objects in the vector will then be randomized leaving a vector of random questions for the game to pull from


//Format will be question on first line
//(Answer 1)correct answer on second line
//(Answer 2)wrong answer on third line
//(Answer 3)wrong answer on fourth line
:
//Begin Next Question
//(Answer 1)correct answer on second line
//(Answer 2)wrong answer on third line
//(Answer 3)wrong answer on fourth line
