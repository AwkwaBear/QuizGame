//This is an example for the format of the questions in the text file
//Each text file will be of a different topic
//When the game is initialized a vector for each topic will be created
//Question objects will be generated for each question saving the correct answer and randomizing //the answer order
//Question object example

class Question{
  string question; //string to store the question
  Answer a1; //each question will have 4 answer objects
  Answer a2;
  Answer a3;
  Answer a4;
}

class Answer{
string a; //string to hold the answer
int correct; //integer to check if the answer is the correct one or not 1 = correct, 2 = incorrect

}

//users will input a number 1-4 to select which answer they are checking, the game will run
check_answer(input) on it which will be something along the lines of what is Below

check_answer(input){
switch(input){
case 1: if (a1->get_correct == 1) {
              return true;
          }
        else{
         return false;
        }
case 2: if (a2->get_correct == 1) {
                return true;
            }
          else{
         return false;
        }
//etc etc for answers 3 and 4
}
}

//The question objects will be placed in their corresponding in the text file and placed in the vector
//the order of the objects in the vector will then be randomized leaving a vector of random questions for the game to pull from


//(Question) Format will be question on first line
//(Answer 1)Correct answer on second line
//(Answer 2)answer on third line
//(Answer 3)answer on fourth line
//(Answer 4)answer on 5th line

//Begin Next Question
//(Answer 1)correct answer on second line
//(Answer 2)wrong answer on third line
//(Answer 3)wrong answer on fourth line
//(letter of correct answer)

//Below is an example

What is the Capital of New York?
Albany
Manchester
New York City
Sacramento

Which of these is not a dog?
Calico
Shiba Inu
Welsh Corgi
Doxen


//Below is an algorithm for how the questions will be randomized
-Create vector
-while loop for while text != EOF
-read in first line of text and set 'string question' equal to first line
-generate a random number 1-4 and save the number as 'int correct'
-set the string of the answer correlating to 'int correct' equal to the next line of the file
-generate a random number
